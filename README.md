# FIFO(first-in-first-out) "Digital Design & Verification"
## in this project , we take the design containing certain bugs & we fix these bugs and verify it using system verilog (SV) & system verilog assertions (SVA). 
## As we create some classes to check & randomize the in/out ports.
## we check the output of the DUT using golden model task in the scoreboard class.
